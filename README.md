# Procedural Mesh Generation with Perlin Noise in Unity

A map that is dynamically generated by using Perlin Noises. With different noises having different frequencies, a height map is generated. Different regions which have different colors are defined for different heights, thus creating a color map. When elevated with the height map and colored with the color map, a 3-dimensional map is created.

Change the seed in Map generator GameObject in order to see different maps.
